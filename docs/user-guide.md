# User guide

What you can do at **aitools.peaslee.org** (also reachable at chat.peaslee.org), tab by tab. Nothing here is about how it's built — for
that see the `CLAUDE.md` files.

## Signing in

If you're not signed in, you land on the **Demo** page (`/demo`) where you can browse public work. Click the **Sign in** button to open the hosted sign-in page; after signing in, you land back on the app. **Sign out** is at the bottom of the left panel on every page. **Profile** (`/profile`) shows the name, email and user id on your account.

Three tabs run along the top of the left panel: **Chat**, **Transcribe**, **Scan**.

## Demo

Visit `/demo` to see a public showcase without signing in. It displays conversations, transcriptions, and scans that owners have marked public — `/demo` itself is the shareable page; there are no separate per-item links to hand out. To mark your own work public, use the **Public** toggle on the active conversation's sidebar row, or on a transcript/scan's detail header. Marking a transcript public also publishes the enrolled speaker names shown in it, not just the transcript text. Files are kept for 30 days, then removed; download before then if you want to keep them.

## Chat

- The left panel lists your conversations; the button at the top starts a new one, ✕ deletes one.
- Pick a **Model** above the message box before the first message of a new conversation. The
  model is fixed for that conversation from then on; start a new conversation to use another.
- Type in the box and press **Enter** to send (**Shift+Enter** for a new line). The conversation
  title is taken from your first message.
- Your history is kept per conversation and reloads when you switch back.

## Transcribe

Upload a recording and get a transcript with the speakers told apart.

**Speaker profiles (optional, left side).** Add a speaker and upload a short reference sample of
their voice — **10 to 60 seconds**, MP3 / WAV / M4A. Once a sample shows **ready**, transcripts
can label that person by name instead of "Speaker 1 / Speaker 2". Click a name to rename it.

**New transcription job.**
1. **New job** → drop an audio file (MP3 / WAV / M4A).
2. Optionally set the **language** and a **speaker count hint**, and tick the speaker profiles you
   expect to hear. You can also add a speaker (with a sample) right in the form.
3. **Submit**. The file uploads, then the job runs. States: **pending → transcribing → matching →
   complete** (or **failed**). The job card and the detail panel update on their own.
4. When it's complete, the **Transcript** shows the segments with speaker labels; the audio player
   lets you listen along. **Matching analysis** shows how confidently each voice was matched to a
   profile (distances and thresholds) — useful when a label looks wrong.

The form also offers a bundled **sample** recording, so you can see a finished result without
uploading anything.

You can have **3 jobs in flight** at a time; the form tells you when to wait for one to finish.

## Scan

Turn a set of photos of one object into a textured 3D model you can spin around in the browser.

### Photos that work

- **5 to 150 photos** of a single object, JPG or PNG.
- Walk around the object taking a photo every 10–20°, keeping the whole object in frame, at a
  steady distance. **Overlap matters most**: each photo should share plenty of the scene with the
  ones before and after it. Big jumps in angle, or photos of different subjects, won't connect.
- Matte, textured, well-lit objects reconstruct best. Shiny, transparent or featureless surfaces
  (glass, chrome, plain walls) are hard.
- Use one camera and one resolution. Photos with a **different resolution** from the rest are
  skipped (you'll see a warning). Phone photos taken in portrait are fine — rotation is handled.
- Blurry or unreadable files are skipped with a warning rather than failing the scan.

The bundled **Sample** (22 photos of a crocheted cat) shows what a good set looks like — open it
with the **Sample** button and look at the thumbnails before shooting your own.

### Starting a scan

- **New scan** → give it a name (or keep the date), drop your photos, **Start scan**. The photos
  upload one by one ("Uploading 12/40"); if the page loses the connection mid-upload, start again.
  Upload links are valid for about 15 minutes.
- **Sample** → the form opens preloaded with the sample photos (you can't edit that set — use
  **Use my own photos instead** to switch). **Start scan** runs it with nothing to upload.
- **3 scans in flight** at a time; more than that is refused with a message.

### While it runs

The card in the left panel and the header show the state: **pending** (uploads finishing) →
**queued** (waiting for the GPU) → **processing · Cameras (SfM) / Dense cloud / Mesh / Texture** →
**complete** or **failed**. The strip across the top of the scan page lights up each stage.

**Photos** are viewable the whole time: the scan page opens on the Photos view while the scan runs,
so you can check the set while you wait. Thumbnails load in as they're prepared ("Loading photos… 7
of 40").

**The GPU bar** (top of the page) tells you what the wait is about. The GPU that does the work is
switched off when nobody is using it, so the first scan after a quiet spell has to wait for it:

- **GPU off — starts on your next job**: nothing is running. Your scan will start it.
- **GPU starting · ~6 min left · 2:10 elapsed**: it's coming up. The estimate is measured from
  recent starts, not a guess; hover the label to see whether this is a **cold start** (a new
  machine has to boot, typically 6–7 minutes) or a **warm start** (the machine is still up from a
  recent job and only the software has to start, about a minute).
- **GPU ready · idle-out in 12:30**: it's running and will switch itself off after 15 idle minutes.
  Scans started before then skip the wait.

**Usage** (right end of the bar) opens a panel with today's and this month's GPU hours against the
caps (3 h/day, 30 h/month), the estimated cost, and **Startups** — how long recent starts actually
took compared with what was promised. It's collapsed to one line; click it to see the last five
starts broken down by stage, each linked to the scan (or transcript) it was started for. If a cap is reached, new scans wait until it resets; the header on the scan shows
the notice.

The **Transcribe** page has the same bar for its own GPU, plus a **Warm it up** button that starts
the GPU before you upload (3 warm-ups per person per day).

### The result

When a scan completes the page switches to the **3D** view:

- **Drag** to orbit, scroll to zoom. The model spins slowly on its own until you touch it.
- A small **Loading mesh… 45%** pill in the corner shows the model downloading — large scans are
  tens of MB, so give it a moment. If it reads *Couldn't load the mesh*, reload the page; if that
  persists, use the download instead.
- **Download GLB** saves the model (opens in any glTF viewer, Blender, etc.); **Download preview**
  saves a still image.
- **Photos** switches to the input photos. Click one to see it full size; **‹ ›** or the **← →**
  keys step through the set; **Esc** closes. After the scan, each thumbnail is marked: **✓** for
  photos that were matched into the model, **not matched** for those that weren't, **skipped** for
  ones that couldn't be used (hover for the reason). The line above the grid sums it up:
  *40 photos · 34 matched*.

**Warnings** appear above the result (and as ⚠ on the card, and briefly as a notice top-right).
Common ones:

- *Mesh simplified from 681,578 to about 500,000 faces to fit the viewer* — a very detailed scan
  was reduced so it loads in the browser; the shape is intact.
- *3 photos with a different resolution were skipped: 0049.jpg, …* or *… unreadable …* — see
  "Photos that work". The scan still runs on the rest.

### When a scan fails

- ***Only 6 of 28 photos could be matched — add overlap and try again*** — the software could
  only connect 6 photos into one consistent set of camera positions. Open **Photos**: the ✓ tiles
  are the ones that connected. Usually it's a run of neighbouring shots; the rest jumped too far or
  don't overlap. Reshoot with smaller steps around the object and more photos where the ✓ run ends.
- Other failures show the message from the reconstruction step. Try again — if the GPU was
  interrupted mid-scan, a retry resumes from the last completed stage rather than starting over.

### Housekeeping

- **✕** in the scan header (or **Esc**) closes the scan and returns to the empty page; the scan
  itself is kept.
- **✕** on a card in the left panel **deletes** the scan and its files (it asks first).
- Scan results and uploaded photos are kept for **30 days**, then removed automatically. Download
  the GLB if you want to keep it.
