# photogrammetry-worker

Standalone Python worker: a run-to-completion ECS task on the shared `gpu-<env>` capacity
provider, launched per job by the API's `RunTask` and exiting itself when idle (lifecycle lives in
`../gpu-worker`). No HTTP server. Takes a confirmed scan's photos from S3, runs COLMAP → OpenMVS →
texturing, and writes `output/mesh.glb` + `output/preview.png` back to S3, walking the job row
through `processing/sfm → dense → mesh → texture → complete`. Live in production since
2026-08-28; the robustness batch (resumable stages, mesh budget, no OOM cycling, photo
normalisation, per-photo status) since 2026-08-29.

## Key Commands

```bash
cd photogrammetry-worker && uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -q                    # 106 tests (2026-08-29); no AWS, DB, COLMAP or OpenMVS needed

# Build the image (context is the repo root; ~10 GB of layers — CI does this on push). Python packages
# are pinned by constraints.txt (pip freeze of the acceptance-tested image); tests/test_constraints.py guards it.
docker build -f photogrammetry-worker/Dockerfile -t photogrammetry-worker:dev .
docker run --env-file .env photogrammetry-worker:dev
```

### Smoke tests

**Production smoke** (after any worker deploy): start the *Sample* scan (22 photos, ≈100 s on an
A10G/T4 once the worker is up) and re-run the 51-photo set — expect ≈680 k faces → refine skipped
→ `--decimate 0.73` → 500 k textured, the "Mesh simplified…" warning on the card, zero
`CAMERA_SINGLE_DIM_ERROR` lines, one attempt. Watch with `scripts/deploy/gpu-status.sh` and
`aws logs tail /ecs/photogrammetry-prod-worker --follow`.

**CPU smoke** (no GPU; slow, tens of minutes) proves the tool chain end to end on the committed
sample (`chat-api/app/assets/photogrammetry/images/`):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/pgsmoke/work /tmp/pgsmoke/images && cp chat-api/app/assets/photogrammetry/images/*.jpg /tmp/pgsmoke/images/
docker run --rm -i -e COLMAP_USE_GPU=0 -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cuda-stubs -v /tmp/pgsmoke:/tmp/pgsmoke photogrammetry-worker:dev python - <<'PY'
import threading, time
from pathlib import Path
from pipeline.reconstruct import Reconstruction
from pipeline.runner import Runner
from pipeline.export import obj_to_glb, make_preview
work, images = Path("/tmp/pgsmoke/work"), Path("/tmp/pgsmoke/images")
r = Reconstruction(Runner(time.monotonic() + 7200, threading.Event()), work, use_gpu=False)
m = r.sfm(images); print("registered", m.registered_images, sorted(m.registered_names)[:3])
d = r.dense(images, m); ply, faces = r.reconstruct_mesh(d); obj = r.texture(d, ply)
print(obj_to_glb(obj, work / "mesh.glb").stat().st_size, make_preview(sorted(images.iterdir())[0], work / "preview.png"))
PY
```

Expected: `registered N` with N ≥ 14 (60 % of 22), a non-trivial `mesh.glb`, and `preview.png`.
The OpenMVS seam-leveling bug reproduces the same way (recipe in `docs/TODO.md`).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | yes (`postgresql+asyncpg://` or `+psycopg2://`; normalised to psycopg2) |
| `AUDIO_BUCKET_NAME` | — | yes |
| `PHOTOGRAMMETRY_SQS_QUEUE_URL` | — | yes |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | no |
| `IDLE_EXIT_SECONDS` | `900` | no — must match the API's `GPU_IDLE_EXIT_SECONDS` |
| `MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS` | `10800` | no — must match `GPU_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS` |
| `PHOTOGRAMMETRY_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `3600` | no — `JobTimeout` fails the row |
| `SQS_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT` | `600` | no — extended every `SQS_VISIBILITY_EXTENSION_INTERVAL` (300) while a job runs |
| `WORK_DIR` | `/tmp/pg` | no — in prod a host-path volume (`/var/lib/photogrammetry`) so scratch survives a container restart |
| `COLMAP_USE_GPU` | `1` | no — `0` runs COLMAP SIFT/matching and OpenMVS (`--cuda-device -2`) on CPU. Off a GPU host also set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cuda-stubs`: OpenMVS binaries need `libcuda.so.1` just to load |
| `TEXTURE_MAX_SIZE` | `4096` | no — pixel budget (this²) per atlas embedded in the GLB after cropping to its used UV box (JPEG q85); a thin strip keeps full resolution |

## Pipeline (as built)

| Step | Row `stage` | What happens | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| load | — | `get` the row; if status ∉ {`queued`, `processing`} → ack and return, remove any scratch | idempotent on redelivery |
| attempts | — | `ApproximateReceiveCount` ≥ `MAX_ATTEMPTS` (5 = the queue's `maxReceiveCount`), or a `stage.started` marker without its `.done` (the previous attempt died mid-stage) → row `failed` ("did not finish after 5 attempts…") | **no OOM cycling**: a stage that crashed is never retried |
| fetch | `sfm` (status → `processing`) | list `input_prefix` (direct children only), download; fail if fewer than `image_count` objects | transient S3 errors (`TRANSIENT_S3_CODES`, connection errors) leave the row `processing` and re-raise (redelivery resumes); permanent ones (`AccessDenied`, `NoSuchKey`) fail the row |
| photos | `sfm` | `pipeline/photos.py`: EXIF orientation applied and stripped (so COLMAP sees upright pixels), unreadable files skipped with a warning, photos whose pixel size differs from the majority skipped (`CAMERA_SINGLE_DIM_ERROR` otherwise); fail if fewer than `MIN_IMAGES` (5) usable | warnings → `job.warnings` |
| SfM | `sfm` | `colmap feature_extractor` → `exhaustive_matcher` → `mapper`; the sub-model with the most registered images wins; `photo_status` written per input (`registered` / `unregistered` / `skipped:<why>`, names read from `images.bin`) **before** the gate | **fail if registered < 60 % of usable** ("Only N of M photos could be matched — add overlap and try again") |
| dense | `dense` | `image_undistorter` → `InterfaceCOLMAP` → `DensifyPointCloud --resolution-level 2` | fixed for the 16 GB T4 |
| mesh | `mesh` | `ReconstructMesh`; then `RefineMesh` **only if** images ≤ `REFINE_MAX_IMAGES` (100) **and** faces ≤ `REFINE_MAX_FACES` (400 k) | refine roughly doubles faces at ~16 GB virtual on 675 k — that OOM-cycled on 2026-08-28 |
| texture | `texture` | `TextureMesh --decimate FACE_BUDGET/faces` when faces > `FACE_BUDGET` (500 k), warning "Mesh simplified from N to about 500,000 faces to fit the viewer"; `--global-seam-leveling 0 --local-seam-leveling 0` (leveling blackens faces in this build — root cause open in `docs/TODO.md`) | |
| export/publish | `publish` | OBJ → GLB **per material** via trimesh (no atlas re-pack, so multi-material meshes are correct); each atlas is cropped to the box its UVs use, capped at `TEXTURE_MAX_SIZE`² pixels and embedded as JPEG q85 (`pipeline/export.py::shrink_atlas`); corners sharing position + UV are welded (`merge_vertices`, OpenMVS writes one `vt` per corner — unwelded geometry, not the atlases, was the bulk of the 51-photo 45 MB GLB), rotated into glTF's y-up; `preview.png` = first input photo at 640 px; upload `output/mesh.glb` + `output/preview.png`; row → `complete` with keys and `completed_at` | |

Each stage writes `<stage>.done` (atomic, JSON payload — e.g. the sfm marker carries `sparse`,
`registered_images`, `registered_names`) under `WORK_DIR/<job_id>/`; a redelivered job resumes at
the first incomplete stage. `main.py` sweeps job dirs older than 24 h at start. Scratch is removed
on success and on deterministic failure; kept on transient failure/interruption for the resume.

## Failure mapping

| Event | Row | SQS |
|---|---|---|
| `StageError`, `JobTimeout`, any other exception in a stage | `failed`, `error_message` = the rule's text or the tool's first stderr line (≤ 1000 chars); `photo_status` and `warnings` kept | acked — a deterministic failure must not retry on a GPU box |
| 5th receive, or a `stage.started` marker with no `.done` | `failed` ("did not finish after 5 attempts (interrupted or out of memory)…") | acked |
| Spot interruption (`gpu_worker.sqs.Interrupted`) | back to `queued`, `stage = NULL` | released with `VisibilityTimeout=0` by `SpotWatcher`; next worker resumes from the markers |
| Transient S3 (`ClientError` with a code in `TRANSIENT_S3_CODES` — SlowDown, Throttling*, RequestTimeout, InternalError, ServiceUnavailable — or any `BotoCoreError`) | stays `processing` | not acked; redelivered after the visibility timeout |
| Permanent S3 (`AccessDenied`, `NoSuchKey`, `NoSuchBucket`, …) | `failed`, `error_message` = the boto message with the code | acked — retrying would only spin to the DLQ with the row stuck `processing` |
| Worker dies mid-job (OOM, crash) | stays `processing` | redelivered; the next attempt sees the `stage.started` marker and fails the row |
| Admin `immediate` release | `queued` | released; the runner aborts the tool process |

## File map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Entry: settings, deps, stale-scratch sweep, `gpu_worker.sqs.run_sqs_worker` with `HANDLERS = {"photogrammetry_job": …}`; passes the receive count to the handler |
| `handlers/photogrammetry.py` | The job: attempts gate, fetch, photos, stages with checkpoints, warnings, photo status, publish, failure mapping |
| `pipeline/photos.py` | Orientation normalisation + usable/skipped/unreadable report |
| `pipeline/colmap.py` | `sparse_reconstruct` (best sub-model, `registered_image_names` from `images.bin`/`images.txt`), `undistort` |
| `pipeline/openmvs.py` | Interface/Densify/Reconstruct/Refine/Texture wrappers; parses face counts from tool output |
| `pipeline/reconstruct.py` | `Reconstruction`: sfm / dense / reconstruct_mesh / refine_mesh / texture(decimate) |
| `pipeline/export.py` | `obj_to_glb` (per-material, y-up), `make_preview` |
| `pipeline/checkpoints.py` | Stage markers, crash detection, `sweep_stale` |
| `pipeline/runner.py` | Subprocess runner with the job deadline and the abort event |
| `models.py` | `PhotogrammetryJob` (duplicated from chat-api on purpose: `warnings`, `photo_status`, keys, stage) |

## Deployment

Push to `main` (changes under `photogrammetry-worker/` or `gpu-worker/`) runs
`.github/workflows/photogrammetry-worker.yml` via `deploy.yml` after the API: buildx build (no
provenance/SBOM manifests — the ECR keep-last-2 rule counts them), ECR push, new
`photogrammetry-prod-worker` task-definition revision. The API's `RunTask` uses the latest revision
on the next launch. The image is also baked into the GPU AMI (`scripts/deploy/build-gpu-ami.sh`);
until a re-bake every cold start pulls the changed layers (~5 min). Terraform
(`infra/modules/photogrammetry`) owns the queue (`maxReceiveCount` 5), the task-definition shape
(host-path scratch volume) and IAM; its `photogrammetry_image_tag` must be set to the deployed SHA
before an apply or the replaced revision points at `latest`. Runbook: `docs/runbooks/deploy.md`.
